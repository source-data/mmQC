# panel-image-matches-caption

## Summary
Check whether each panel image matches its caption description — that is, whether what is shown in the image is consistent with what the caption says is shown.

Proceed step-by-step and establish a systematical strategy to be very accurate and avoid mistakes.

## List and classify all figure panels

To be systematic, start from a complete and accurate list of all the figure's panels. Before you do anything else, list every panel and classify it by content type, as follows. Proceed step-by-step and be accurate.

### 1. Get all the panels

Understand the figure image and see where there are figure sub-parts or
"panels". Each panel depicts an experiment either with a plot, a micrograph,
some other kinds of images, a scheme.

- Panels are typically labeled with consecutive letters (for example: A, B, C,
  ... or (a), (b), (c)).
- There are sometimes subpanels. For example "a)", "a')", "a'')" or "Ai)", "Aii)", "Aiii)" or "B top", "B bottom" or "C left", "C right". Consider them as individual panels.
- The first panel is usually on the top left. The last panel tends to be on the
  bottom right. Sometimes the layout is however a bit messy.
- Record the label without its brackets, so that `(a)` is reported as `a`.
  Report the labels the figure actually carries: do not invent, reorder or
  renumber them.
- Sometimes one panel can include several images. For example, a panel can include both a microscopy image and a plot that typically displays a
quantification of some features shown on the image.
- When the image alone leaves the panel structure or sequence unclear, use the
  caption: it usually names the panels in order and says which images belong
  to which panel.

You must analyze each labeled panel independently, even if panels are related.

### 2. Name every content type in the panel

Classify each panel using the following types:

| type | what it covers |
|---|---|
| `micrograph` | anything imaged through a microscope — light, phase-contrast, fluorescence, confocal, electron micrograph, kymograph |
| `plot` | data presented against axes or categories - bar, line, scatter, box,
violin, histogram, pie, donut charts, heatmaps |
| `blot` | a gel-based result — western, northern or southern blot, SDS-PAGE or agarose gel, autoradiograph, Coomassie stain |
| `molecular_or_protein_structure` | a rendering of the three-dimensional structure of a molecule — protein ribbon, cartoon or surface representation; a small molecule or chemical structure; a nucleic acid or a complex; a crystal structure, a cryo-EM density map, a docking pose or a predicted model |
| `sequence` | DNA, RNA or protein sequence shown as letters — a raw or annotated sequence, a region with mutations marked, a primer or guide design, a multiple sequence alignment |
| `schematic` | a drawing that explains rather than presents measured data — experimental design, model, pathway, cartoon, timeline |
| `photograph` | a macroscopic photograph — whole organism, culture plate, tissue specimen, apparatus |
| `table` | values laid out in labelled rows and columns rather than drawn |
| `other` | anything the list above does not cover.|


Note of caution: **A plot drawn inside a schematic, for illustration rather than to
  present data, is not a plot.** An idealised curve in a model diagram, a sketched bar
  chart in an experimental-design cartoon: report `schematic` alone.

### 3. A panel can hold several things

**Report every type present, not the single most prominent one.** A micrograph
beside the bar chart quantifying it is "micrograph, plot". A blot above
the densitometry of its own bands is "blot, plot". A structure shown next
to the binding curve that supports it is
"molecular_or_protein_structure, plot".

Dropping the second type silently removes that panel from whichever check cares
about it.

### 4. Report every panel

Report **every** panel from step 1, in label order, including panels
whose content looks irrelevant to whatever this check is about. This
check decides what is relevant; dropping a panel here silently removes
it from that decision. A panel you cannot classify at all gets `other`, never an empty list.

### 5. How to report it

State the classification in your own reply, as a comma-separated list with one
entry per panel, in label order. Each entry carries two things:

- the panel's label, exactly as you recorded it in step 1;
- every content type you found, from the vocabulary above, as a list.

## Applicability of the check to panels the caption describes

For each panel, find the part of the caption that describes it. One caption sentence can cover several panels; this is usually indicated by the panel labels in brackets, before or after the caption text.

If the caption gives no specific description of a panel, the check does not apply to it: set `image_matches_caption` to "not_applicable", leave `discrepancies` empty, and skip the next two sections.

## Compare the image against the caption

**This is a judgment call.** Minor stylistic differences are not discrepancies. Focus on substantive mismatches that could mislead a reader:

- the wrong plot type;
- missing conditions, timepoints or groups;
- contradictory labels;
- elements described in the caption that are absent from the image, and elements in the image that the caption does not account for.

Set `image_matches_caption` to "yes" if the image is consistent with what the caption describes, and to "no" if there is a substantive mismatch.

## Describe the discrepancy

Put a short description of the mismatch in `discrepancies`. If there is none, leave it empty.

Describe what differs, concretely: say which element the caption promises and the image lacks, or the reverse. A discrepancy that cannot be stated specifically is usually a stylistic difference, which is not a discrepancy.

## Please note:
- Report every panel of the figure, including panels the caption does not describe, which take `not_applicable` and an empty `discrepancies`.
